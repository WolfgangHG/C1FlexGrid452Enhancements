# C1FlexGrid enhancements

This repository contains some enhancements to ComponentOne C1FlexGrid (https://www.grapecity.com/componentone/winforms-ui-controls)
Currently, all three samples use the NuGet package "C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.4.5.2"

## C1FlexGridBorderPainter
The sample [C1FlexGridBorderPainter](/C1FlexGrid452BorderPainter) contains a helper class that simplies the drawing of borders in C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.

## C1FlexGridStyleHandler
The sample [C1FlexGridStyleHandler](/C1FlexGrid452StyleHandler) contains a helper class that simplies the formatting of cells in a C1.Win.C1FlexGrid 
by using styles


## Copy to Office
The sample [Copy to Office](/C1FlexGrid452CopyOffice) contains a helper class that shows how to write the C1.Win.C1FlexGrid 
content to the clipboard so that it can be pasted to Word/Excel/Outlook and the formatting is kept.  
The same code can also be used to export a C1FlexGrid to Html.
