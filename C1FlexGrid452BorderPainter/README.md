# C1FlexGrid enhancements: BorderPainter

This sample shows a way to define custom borders in a ComponentOne C1FlexGrid (https://www.grapecity.com/componentone/winforms-ui-controls)

Normally, you create borders this way:

~~~~
CellStyle styleWithBorder = this.c1FlexGrid.Styles.Add("WithBorder", this.c1FlexGrid.Styles.Normal);
styleWithBorder.Border.Style = BorderStyleEnum.Flat;
styleWithBorder.Border.Color = Color.Red;
styleWithBorder.Border.Width = 2;
styleWithBorder.Border.Direction = BorderDirEnum.Both;
~~~~

This style has a border to the right and the bottom, with red lines of width "2".

Later, you apply this CellStyle to single cells:

~~~~
this.c1FlexGrid.SetCellStyle(row, col, styleWithBorder);
~~~~

You have to set the style to each single cell.
The border applies only to the right/bottom border of a cell. To create a top border, you have to create a style with only bottom border ("Border.Direction = BorderDirEnum.Horizontal") and set this style to the cell above the current cell.
Same for a left border: create a style with only a right border ("Border.Direction = BorderDirEnum.Vertical") and set this style to the cell left to the current cell.

To simplify this, this sample contains a helper class "C1FlexGridBorderPainter".

The result looks like this:

## Usage of "C1FlexGridBorderPainter"
To use it:
Define a membervariable of your form/usercontrol. The sample uses creates two different borders and thus creates two border painter:
~~~~
private C1FlexGridBorderPainter borderPainterRed;
private C1FlexGridBorderPainter borderPainterGreen;
~~~~

Initialize it somewhere in your code:
Provide the C1FlexGrid and a Pen in the constructor call.
Then, you have to tell the border painter how many rows/cols the grid has.
~~~~
//Create border painter with red border:
this.borderPainterRed = new C1FlexGridBorderPainter(this.c1FlexGrid, Pens.Red);
this.borderPainterRed.ResetGrid(this.c1FlexGrid.Rows.Count, this.c1FlexGrid.Cols.Count);

//Create border painter with green border and width "2 pixel":
Pen penGreen = new Pen(Color.Green, 2);
this.borderPainterGreen = new C1FlexGridBorderPainter(this.c1FlexGrid, penGreen);
this.borderPainterGreen.ResetGrid(this.c1FlexGrid.Rows.Count, this.c1FlexGrid.Cols.Count);
~~~~

If you add rows/cols to the grid or remove them, the borderpainter does not detect it itself - so call "ResetGrid" again or 
call "InsertRows"/"RemoveRows"/"InsertCols"/"RemoveCols".

If you refill the grid with different data, call "ResetGrid", which resets all borders.

Next, define some borders:

~~~~
this.borderPainterRed.SetBorders(3, 3, 3, 5);
this.borderPainterRed.SetBorders(7, 3, 8, 4);

//This is just a right border (which means: a vertical line)
this.borderPainterGreen.SetBorders(0, 1, this.c1FlexGrid.Rows.Count - 1, 1, BorderType.Right);

//And another partial border:
this.borderPainterGreen.SetBorders(10, 3, 11, 4, BorderType.Right | BorderType.Left | BorderType.Bottom);
~~~~

Then, active owner drawing for the grid:
~~~~
this.c1FlexGrid.DrawMode = C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.DrawModeEnum.OwnerDraw;
this.c1FlexGrid.OwnerDrawCell += c1FlexGrid_OwnerDrawCell;
~~~~

In der "c1FlexGrid_OwnerDrawCell", make the border painter calls:
~~~~
private void c1FlexGrid_OwnerDrawCell(object sender, C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.OwnerDrawCellEventArgs e)
{
  //First draw the cell:
  e.DrawCell();

  //Then draw our borders:
  //Note: if border from two border painter might overlap, the latest border will win:
  this.borderPainterRed.DrawBorders(e);
  this.borderPainterGreen.DrawBorders(e);
}
~~~~


## Disposing of Pen objects
If you create custom pens, you should dispose them (e.g. the green Pen in my sample). So store them in a member variable
and dispose them when the Form / UserControl is disposed.
